    1. Group by Functionality: Considering the growth you're expecting (mainly more pages), you might want to structure your components folder more around the pages of your application. For example, if you have an about page, a home page, and a photo page, you could have an About, Home, and Photo directory inside your components directory. Each of these directories would contain the components specific to those pages. This would help you quickly find related components as your app grows.

    2. Shared Components: It's also common to have a directory for shared components. These are components that are used in multiple places throughout your application. You could create a Shared or Common directory inside your components directory for these.

    3. Assets: Consider having a separate folder for different types of assets if you're planning to have more of them in the future. For instance, separate folders for images, icons, and other static assets might be helpful for organization.

    4. Styles: As you're using TailwindCSS, you'll mainly apply styles through utility classes in your components. However, if you find yourself writing custom CSS, you might want to consider setting up a dedicated folder for these styles.

    5. Services: If you foresee needing to interact with any external APIs or services (like fetching data), it can be useful to have a dedicated services directory for that code. This isn't necessary for a static site, but if your site grows to include dynamic content, it could be helpful.

    Util/Helpers: If you have any general utility functions or constants that you're using in multiple places, you could consider creating a util or helpers directory at the top level of your src.
