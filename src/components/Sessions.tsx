      <p className="text-2xl"> 60 minute Reiki Sessions $90</p> 
      <p className="text-2xl mb-6"> Mindfulness Consulting Included</p> 
      <p className="text-[#974] my-2">At the moment, I am taking appointments on Sundays and Monday evenings.</p>
      <p className="text-[#974] my-2">My studio is out of my home in the Renton Highlands, I have made it a very cozy and peaceful space to share.</p>
      <p className="text-[#974] my-2">I recommend comfortable, non bulky clothing but anything will do. You will not need to undress.</p>


      <p className="text-2xl my-6  ">~What to Expect~</p> 
      <p className="text-[#974] my-2">Sessions will start with a general check in, this can be quick or extensive. We will use our time depending on what is needed.</p>
      <p className="text-[#974] my-2">During Table Time I let the energy guide me, scanning the Chakras and flowing energy to those that are in need of attention. I focus on ailments in all planes; mental, emotional, physical, spiritual and will bring in Crystals and Vibrational Sound to enhance healing if it feels right. This time will generally be very relaxing and mind clearing.</p>
      <p className="text-[#974] my-2">We will end the session with another check in. I will let you know if I felt a strong pull in specific Chakras and can recommend Mindfulness tips on how to continue your healing outside of sessions. Mending inner and outer pain is a lifelong journey and centered around consistency so any other way I can assist, I will try my best to share.</p>
      <p className="text-[#974] my-2">To schedule a session with me, please send me a message of your preferred time(s) and I will get back to you with my availability.</p>
      <p className="text-[#974] my-2">I am looking forward to connecting {":)"}</p>
